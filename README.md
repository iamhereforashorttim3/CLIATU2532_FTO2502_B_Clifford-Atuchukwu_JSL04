# JSL04 Challenge

## Overview:
I was tasked with dynamically displaying tasks that were initially given to us onto the dom
with the use of Javascript. If a task is clciked then a modal should open where user can view/modify
task details.

## How to run:
* Download the files in the repo (assets being optional)
* Place the files within a folder
* Run the folder in Visual Studio code
* Use the live view feature to see the web page

### Technology used:
* Javascript
* CSS
* HTML

## Initial thoughts:
I didn't come into this project too confident, I was still trying to get used to the DOM and the use of functions
and I was extremely sick so seeing the overview including the figma design was quite daunting.

## Struggles:
* Trying to create the modal was a challenge. Perhaps it might have been because I am a bit rusty when it came to 
CSS especially after studying Javascript

* Making sure some of the functions actually worked as intended. I went through trial and error trying to make the 
cancel button and the displaying of the description section actually work

* Not a struggle with the programming in itself, but my device and internet were both running at a snails pace. There
were moments where I would face up to a minute delay for my code to actually appear after typing it in.
